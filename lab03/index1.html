                <p>CSS Grid Layout introduces a two-dimensional grid system to CSS. Grids can be used to lay out major page areas or small user interface elements. This article introduces the CSS Grid Layout and the new terminology that is part of the CSS Grid Layout Level 1 specification. The features shown in this overview will then be explained in greater detail in the rest of this guide.</p>

                <p>All the direct children are now grid items. In a web browser, you won't see any difference to how these items are displayed before turning them into a grid, as grid has created a single column grid for the items. At this point, you may find it useful to work with the Grid Inspector, available as part of Firefox's Developer Tools. If you view this example in Firefox and inspect the grid, you will see a small icon next to the value grid. Click this and then the grid on this element will be overlaid in the browser window.</p>

                <p>When setting up an explicit grid or defining the sizing for automatically created rows or columns we may want to give tracks a minimum size, but also ensure they expand to fit any content that is added. For example, I may want my rows to never collapse smaller than 100 pixels, but if my content stretches to 300 pixels in height, then I would like the row to stretch to that height.</p>
